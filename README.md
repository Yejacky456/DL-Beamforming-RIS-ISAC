# Unsupervised-Learning-Joint-Beamforming-Design-RIS-ISAC
This repository contains the source codes for ``Unsupervised Learning for Joint Beamforming Design in RIS-aided ISAC Systems'' accepted by IEEE Wireless Communications Letters. 

The paper of the work can be found in the link "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533223"

The code is run by GPU. It is suggested implementing the CUDA-base pytorch framework to speed up the training. If no GPU available, one can modify the second paragraph to be device='cpu' to run the code in CPU. 

If the readers have any questions about the code, feel free to contact "julianye953@163.com".

If you found the code is useful for your research, please cite this paper:
